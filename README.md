# System Engineering and DevOps

## Project Description

This repository contains projects related to System Engineering and DevOps practices, focusing on web infrastructure design, network configuration, automation, and other essential DevOps concepts. Through these projects, we explore the fundamentals of scalable, secure, and monitored web infrastructures.

## Repository Structure

- **web_infrastructure_design/**: Detailed documentation of various web infrastructure designs with increasing complexity:
  - `0-simple_web_stack`: A simple one-server web infrastructure
  - `1-distributed_web_infrastructure`: Three-server web infrastructure with load balancing
  - `2-secured_and_monitored_web_infrastructure`: Secure and monitored three-server web infrastructure
  - `3-scale_up`: Scaled-up infrastructure with component separation

## Web Infrastructure Design Project

In the `web_infrastructure_design` directory, we explore different web infrastructure models:

### Project Components

1. **Simple Web Stack**:
   - Single server setup with LAMP stack
   - Basic domain configuration
   - Analysis of single points of failure

2. **Distributed Web Infrastructure**:
   - Multiple server setup
   - Introduction to load balancing
   - Database primary-replica architecture

3. **Secured and Monitored Web Infrastructure**:
   - Implementation of firewalls
   - SSL/TLS encryption
   - Monitoring solutions
   - Security considerations

4. **Scaled Up Web Infrastructure**:
   - Component separation
   - Improved redundancy
   - Cluster configuration for load balancers
   - Dedicated servers for specific functions

## Learning Objectives

Through this repository, you will learn:

- How to design robust and scalable web infrastructures
- The role of different components in a web stack
- How to implement security measures in a web infrastructure
- The importance of monitoring in DevOps practices
- How to identify and mitigate single points of failure
- Best practices for high availability and redundancy
- Principles of database replication and load balancing

## Requirements

- Basic understanding of networking concepts
- Knowledge of web servers (like Nginx, Apache)
- Familiarity with databases (particularly MySQL)
- Understanding of load balancing principles
- Basic security concepts
